# Codebop Track Tennis

This is a coded music version of a traditional music production game where artists pass tracks between them, wach making small edits. In our version, the tracks are coded!

## Instructions

1. To work on a track, assign yourself to its GitHub Issue.
  a. If no tracks are available, or you feel inspired to start a new track, add one and create an issue for it.
  b. File tracks according to language/platform, use any you like.
2. Make your changes to the track. Be inspired by the previous artists' work, but make any changes you like.
  a. Add any new samples you use to the 'samples' directory
  b. Record the license of your samples in 'samples/attributions.txt'.
3. Merge your changes as a PR and unassign yourself from the track's Issue.
  a. As a bonus, consider posting a video or recording of your track. Let's aim to make a video showing the tracks evolving.

Have fun!
